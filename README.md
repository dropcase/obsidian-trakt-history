## Obsidian Trakt Importer Plugin

A plugin that pulls [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/) history, then imports into your vault.

### Features

#### TBD

The plugin allows you to import your preexisting media collection and upgrade them to Media DB entries.

### How to install

**The plugin is now released, so it can be installed directly through obsidian's plugin installer.**

Alternatively, you can manually download the zip archive from the latest release here on GitHub.  
After downloading, extract the archive into the `.obsidian/plugins` folder in your vault.

The folder structure should look like this:

```
[path to your vault]
|_ .obsidian
   |_ plugins
      |_ obsidian-media-db-plugin
         |_ main.js
         |_ manifest.json
         |_ styles.css
```
